<h3>WHY I CHOSE MORINGA</h3>
<P> It's rewarding <br>
    It's great to see something you create being used by other people. When a client comes back to me and asks for a bugfix, I know it's because they're using my program, and it's wonderful to know that you've helped someone. It also helps that programming can be pretty lucrative.
